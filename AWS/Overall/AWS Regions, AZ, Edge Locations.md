## OVERALL

Amazon EC2 is hosted in multiple locations world-wide. 

These locations are composed of regions and Availability Zones. 

Each **region** is a separate geographic area. 

Each region has multiple, isolated locations known as **Availability Zones**. 

Amazon EC2 provides you the ability to place resources, such as instances, and data in multiple locations. 

Resources aren't replicated across regions unless you do so specifically.

____________________________________________

Each region is completely independent. 

Each Availability Zone is isolated, but the Availability Zones in a region are connected through low-latency links. 

____________________________________________
2018:
  - 18 geographic regions;
  - 55 AZ in them (12 more to add);
  - 1 local region;
