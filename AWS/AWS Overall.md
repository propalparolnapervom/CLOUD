## OVERALL

In 2006, **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** started to offer IT services to the market in the form of web services, which is nowadays known as **cloud computing**.

**Cloud computing** is an internet-based computing service in which large groups of remote servers are networked to allow centralized data storage, and online access to computer services or resources. Using cloud computing, organizations can use shared computing and storage resources rather than building, operating, and improving infrastructure on their own.

There are three types of clouds:

  - **Public Cloud**: The third-party service providers make resources and services available to their customers via Internet. Customer’s data and related security is with the service providers’ owned infrastructure.

  - **Private Cloud**: Also provides almost similar features as public cloud, but the data and services are managed by the organization or by the third party only for the customer’s organization. In this type of cloud, major control is over the infrastructure so security related issues are minimized.

  - **Hybrid Cloud**: A hybrid cloud is the combination of both private and public cloud. The decision to run on private or public cloud usually depends on various parameters like sensitivity of data and applications, industry certifications and required standards, regulations, etc.
