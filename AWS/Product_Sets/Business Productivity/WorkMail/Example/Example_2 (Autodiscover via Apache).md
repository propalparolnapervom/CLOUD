# EXAMPLE_2 (Autodiscover via Apache)


Setup Amazon WorkMail:
  - for organization `xbs-united` (so e-mail available via browser via [https://xbs-united.awsapps.com/mail](https://xbs-united.awsapps.com/mail))
  - for (already existing) domain `xburser.com` (which looks to your local PC)
  - for user `xburser`
  - AutoDiscover via Apache on your local PC (so Phase 2 from [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/autodiscover.html))

(so working e-mail `xburser@xburser.com` has to be as a result)
