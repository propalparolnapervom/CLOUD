## OVERALL

**WorkMail** is a secure, managed business email and calendaring service with support for existing desktop and mobile email clients. 

You can access your email, contacts, and calendars using Microsoft Outlook, your browser, or their native iOS and Android email applications. 

You can integrate Amazon WorkMail with your existing corporate directory and control both the keys that encrypt your data and the location in which your data is stored.

You can access Amazon WorkMail using the web application: [https://*alias*.awsapps.com/mail](https://*alias*.awsapps.com/mail).





## SUPPORTED AWS REGIONS AND ENDPOINT

[List](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#wm_region) of supported AWS Regions and endpoints for AWS WorkMail.

P.S.

To reduce data latency in your APP, most Amazon Web Services offer a regional endpoint to make your requests. 

An **endpoint** is a URL that is the entry point for a web service. 

> For example, https://dynamodb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com is an entry point for the Amazon DynamoDB service.

Some services, such as IAM, do not support regions; therefore, their endpoints do not include a region. Some services, such as Amazon EC2, let you specify an endpoint that does not include a specific region, for example, https://ec2.amazonaws.com. In that case, AWS routes the endpoint to us-east-1.

If a service supports regions, the resources in each region are independent. 

> For example, if you create an Amazon EC2 instance or an Amazon SQS queue in one region, the instance or queue is independent from instances or queues in another region.
