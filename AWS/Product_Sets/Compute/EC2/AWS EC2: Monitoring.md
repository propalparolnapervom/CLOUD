# AWS EC2: MONITORING

## OVERALL

Standard monitoring = 5 minutes.

Detailed monitoring = 1 minute (for some extra money).

**Cloud Watch** is used for performance monitoring (CPU Util, Network throughtput, Disk Util, etc).

**CloudTrail** is for auditing (any API call, anything you do in the AWS console will be recorded here).
