# AWS ROUTE53: ROUTING POLICIES


## SIMPLE

**Simple**: Route53 responds to queries based only on the values in this record. 

You can only have one record with multiply IP addresses. If you specify multiply values in a record, Route53 returns all values to the user in a random order. 

This is the default routing policy when you create a new record set.

This is most commonly used when you have a single resource that performs a given function for your domain.

> For example, one web server that serves content for the [http://ukr.net](http://ukr.net) website.


## WEIGHTED

**Weighted**: Route53 responds to queries based on Weighting that you specify in this and other record sets that have the same name and type.

It lets you split your traffic based on different weights assigned.

You might not see this in a few minutes, you can notice result during the whole day.

> For example, you can set 10% of your traffic to go to ELB1 and other 90% - to ELB2 (they might be in different regions or in one).



## LATENCY

**Latency**: Route53 responds to queries based on Regions that you specify in this and other record sets that have the same name and type.

It allows you to route your traffic based on the lowest network latency for your end user (i.e. which region will give them the fastest responce time).

To use latency-based routing you create a latency resource record set for the EC2 (or ELB) resource in each region that hosts your website. 

When Route53 receives a query for your site, it selects the latency resource record set for the region that gives the user the lowest latency. Route53 then responds with the value associated with that resource reocord set. 


## FAILOVER

**Failover**: Route53 responds to queries using primary record sets if any are healthy, or using secondary record sets otherwise.

It is used when you want to create an active/passive set up. 

> For example, you may want your primary site to be in EU-WEST-2 and your secondary DR site in AP-SOUTHEAST-2.

Route53 will monitor the health of your primary site using a health check. A **health check** monitors the health of your end points. It can be created separately in Route53 service.


## GEOLOCATION

**Geolocation**: Route53 responds to queries based on the locations from which DNS queries originate. We recommend that you create a Default location resource record set.

It lets you choose where your traffic will be sent base on the geographic location of your user (i.e. location from which DNS queries originate).

> For example, you might want all queries from Europe to be routed to a fleet of EC2 instances that are specifically configured for your European customers. These servers may have the local language of your European customer and all prices are displayed in Euros.
