# VPC: VPC FLOW LOGS

## OVERALL

**VPC Flow Logs** is a feature that enables you to capture info about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.

Flow Logs data is stored using Amazon **CloudWatch** Logs.

After you've created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

You cannot enable Flow Logs for VPCs that are peered with your VPC unless the peer VPC is in your account;

You cannot tag a flow log;

After you've created a Flow Log, you cannot change its configuration; for example, you can't associate a different IAM role with the flow log.

Not all IP traffic is monitored. Following cases are not monitored:
  - traffic generated by instances when they contact the Amazon DNS server. If you use your own DNS server, then all traffic to that DNS server is logged;
  - traffic generated by a Windows instance for Amazon Windows license activation;
  - traffic to and from 169.254.169.254 for instance metadata;
  - DHCP traffic;
  - trafic to the reserved IP addresses for the default VPC router;


## LEVELS

Flow Logs can be created at 3 different levels:
  - VPC;
  - Subnet;
  - Network Interface Level.
