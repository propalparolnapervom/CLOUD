# AWS IDENTITY ACCESS MANAGEMENT (IAM)

## OVERALL

**Identity Access Management (IAM)** allows you to manage users and their access to the AWS console.

Activate **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** on your AWS root account to add another layer of protection to help keep your account secure. Learn More


**IAM roles**

IAM roles are a secure way to grant permissions to entities that you trust. Examples of entities include the following:

- IAM user in another account
- Application code running on an EC2 instance that needs to perform actions on AWS resources
- An AWS service that needs to act on resources in your account to provide its features
- Users from a corporate directory who use identity federation with SAML
- IAM roles issue keys that are valid for short durations, making them a more secure way to grant access.
